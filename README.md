<!-- About The Project -->
<h2><strong>&#x1F9D0 About the Project</strong></h2>
<p>This project was created specifically to meet my needs after installing Ubuntu on my computer. However, since the script I created was so good (at least for me), I decided that it was not fair to keep it just for me. So I thought: "why not share it with the world?".</p>
<p>I bet you must have already wasted a lot of time downloading all your programs again after formatting your PC, right? You need to download a more updated program and so on... YUCK!</p>
<p>No more! Automate your processes and optimize your time! Let my script do all the work for you!</p>
